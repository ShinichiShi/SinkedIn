/**
 * Performance optimization tips for profile loading:
 * 
 * 1. Database Indexes:
 *    - Add composite index on posts: (userId, deleted, timestamp)
 *    - Add index on users collection for faster lookups
 * 
 * 2. Firestore Rules Optimization:
 *    - Ensure read rules are efficient
 *    - Consider using security rules that don't require additional reads
 * 
 * 3. Client-side optimizations:
 *    - Implement proper caching strategies
 *    - Use React.memo for expensive components
 *    - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
 * 
 * 4. API optimizations:
 *    - Batch database reads where possible
 *    - Use parallel Promise.all for independent operations
 *    - Implement proper error handling and timeouts
 * 
 * 5. Network optimizations:
 *    - Use CDN for images
 *    - Implement proper HTTP caching headers
 *    - Consider using server-side caching for frequently accessed data

Profile Loading Optimization Checklist:

✅ Created optimized /api/users/[id]/profile endpoint
✅ Added dedicated /api/users/[id]/posts endpoint  
✅ Implemented request timeouts to prevent hanging
✅ Added proper error handling and user feedback
✅ Created loading states for better UX
✅ Optimized useUserProfile hook to reduce API calls

Next Steps for Production:
1. Add Firestore indexes for better query performance
2. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed profiles
3. Add image optimization and lazy loading
4. Monitor performance with analytics
5. Consider implementing pagination for posts
