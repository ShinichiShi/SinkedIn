1. Why We Use the Emulator
    The Firebase Emulator allows you to:

    Develop without touching production data.
    Test Firestore locally.

    Use mocked authentication (but with limitations).

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation

    üî¥ Google Sign-In does NOT work with the Firebase Auth Emulator.
    The emulator does not support real OAuth flows (Google, Facebook,   etc.).
    Popups will fail with auth/popup-closed-by-user.

    For this reason, the Auth Emulator is currently disabled in our     local setup.

    We use real Google login in dev mode until a mock/fake login flow   is implemented.

2. What is Enabled in Dev Mode
    Firestore Emulator ‚úÖ (port 8080)
    Storage Emulator ‚úÖ (if needed)
    Auth Emulator ‚ùå (disabled because Google OAuth cannot be used)

3. How to Run Locally
    Install Firebase CLI:
    ```
    bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    firebase emulators:start --only firestore,storage
    ```
    Run the Next.js dev server:
    ```
    bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Switching Between Emulator and Production
    We control emulator usage via .env.local:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_USE_EMULATOR=false
    ```
    false ‚Üí Uses real Firebase (with Google login).

    true ‚Üí Would connect to emulator, but Auth Emulator is skipped.

5. Firebase Config Behavior
If NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_USE_EMULATOR=true ‚Üí Firestore connects to local emulator.
Auth Emulator is intentionally not connected because Google login would fail.
You can still test other auth methods (email/password) by manually enabling it.

6. Adding Back Auth Emulator (Optional)
    If you later implement fake Google login for dev:
    Uncomment the connectAuthEmulator line in firebaseConfig.js.
    Use a mock Google credential for sign-in.

    Example:
    ```js
    import { GoogleAuthProvider, signInWithCredential } from "firebase/ auth";
    const fakeCredential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential(
      '{"sub":"1234567890","email":"testuser@gmail.com",    "email_verified":true}'
    );
    await signInWithCredential(auth, fakeCredential);
    ```
