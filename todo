feed generation system for following tab : 
    Long-term Recommendation
    For a production app with many users following many people, consider implementing a feed generation system:

    Pre-generate feeds when users post content
    Store individual user feeds in a separate collection
    Update feeds asynchronously using Cloud Functions
    Query the pre-generated feed instead of real-time aggregation

    This approach scales much better than real-time aggregation queries and reduces the number of required indexes.
